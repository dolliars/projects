          <p class="projects__description">I used a template engine to build this site. My primary concern was being able to add a project in a quick and simple manner. All projects are therefore JSON objects. I also wanted to keep the aesthetic of the site clean and simple so chose to display the projects in vertical card-like list.</p>

          <p class="projects__description">I wanted to playing around with APIs. Here I&#39;m using Studio Ghibli&#39;s API to get the title and description of movies. Initially this was set up using a XMLHttpRequest. I decided to change it to use Fetch API.</p>

          <p class="projects__description">Inspired by a conversation between Shane Parrish and Adam Grant on The Knowledge Project podcast, I decided to write a twitter bot that asked the same question on a daily basis. One issue that came up was that the Twitter API throws an error when a duplicate status is detected. To circumvent the issue, I added the ordinal date as the first part of the tweet. I also created and launched an aws ec2 instance to serve the code.</p>

          <p class="projects__description">One of my objectives is to become a better programmer and writer. A blog is an excellent way to do both. After a few iterations I found it was easier to write when addressing a specific person. Hence the birth of &quot;Hey Heather, it&#39;s me again&quot;. I write about general things I&#39;ve been working and things I don&#39;t understand.</p>

          <p class="projects__description">At my previous office, many of the sites we managed were changing to React. I left before the changes happened so decide to try React on my own time.</p>
