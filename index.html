          <p class="projects__description">Using JavaScript, I render text on a webpage by splitting it into cards which the user can click through. This was an experiment looking into a different way to present text on the web.</p>

          <p class="projects__description">Working with a subject-matter expert, I&#39;ve collaborated on multiple programming zines, helping bring clarity to complicated software subjects. I ask questions and identify confusing explanations. I also make suggestions to help explain the subject.</p>

          <p class="projects__tech">tech: aws ec2, twitter api, javascript, git</p>
          <p class="projects__description">I wrote a twitter bot that asked the same question daily after being inspired by a conversation between Shane Parrish and Adam Grant on The Knowledge Project podcast. An issue that came up was that the Twitter API throws an error when a duplicate status is detected. To circumvent this, I added the ordinal date as the first part of the tweet. The accound has since been retired.</p>

          <p class="projects__tech">tech: markdown, jekyll, liquid, ruby, css, javascript, git</p>
          <p class="projects__description">I started blogging in order to become a better programmer and writer. After a few iterations I found it was easier to write when addressing a specific person. Hence the birth of &quot;Hey Heather, it&#39;s me again&quot;. I write about general things I&#39;ve been working on and things I don&#39;t understand.</p>

          <p class="projects__tech">tech: gulp, nunjucks, javascript, css, node, git</p>
          <p class="projects__description">I used a template engine to build this site. My primary concern was being able to add a project in a quick and simple manner. All projects are therefore JSON objects. I also wanted to keep the aesthetic of the site clean and simple so chose to display the projects in a vertical card-like list.</p>

          <p class="projects__tech">tech: javascript, studio ghibli api, css, git</p>
          <p class="projects__description">I wanted to play around with APIs. Here I&#39;m using Studio Ghibli&#39;s API to get the title and description of movies. Initially this was set up using a XMLHttpRequest. I decided to change it to use the Fetch API.</p>

          <p class="projects__tech">tech: react, javascript, git</p>
          <p class="projects__description">At my previous office, many of the sites we managed were changing to React. I left before the changes were implemented so decide to try it out on my own by building a basic CRUD interface.</p>

          <p class="projects__tech">tech: soldering</p>
          <p class="projects__description">I built myself a pair of speakers out of ceiling panels, wires, and will. The most challenging part was soldering the wires to the audio exciters but I managed to connect everything. This links to a blog post about the experience.</p>
