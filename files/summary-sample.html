        <h2>Review of issue</h2>
        <p>What we found: <b>infinite scrolling is breaking the “back” functionality</b>. It is
          also uncommonly used on e-commerce sites and is a hindrance for task oriented users.</p>
        <p>We’ve concluded that infinite scroll has many negative effects that disturb the user
        experience. Therefore we recommend removing infinite scrolling and return to using
        pagination.</p>
        <p>Benefits: This will fix the issue with the “back” button and will resolve a separate
        SEO issue that was brought to our attention by the marketing team. The issue being that
        currently Google bot is unable to crawl the products page.</p>

        <h3>UX Research</h3>
        <p>Nielsen Norman Group (NNG) is a UX research and consulting firm that publishes many of
        their findings for the design of websites and applications. They’ve researched the question
        and the different considerations to take into account. From going over articles they
        published, our recommendation is to revert to pagination.</p>
        <p><b>Moving forward we should:</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Remove infinite scroll and use pagination instead</li>
          <li>Provide pagination options for users with one of the following:
            <ul>
              <li>3 options: a base minimum, a large increment and a “View All” (e.g. 24, 120, View All)</li>
              <li>2 options: a base minimum and a “View All” option</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Notable findings:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Etsy spent months developing and testing infinite scroll only to <b>revert back to
              pagination</b>. They found that the feature had a negative impact on engagement with
            fewer clicks, fewer favorited items and users stopped using search.</li>
          <li>Infinite scrolling is the <b>wrong choice for websites that support goal-oriented
              tasks</b>, e.g. for someone looking for a specific clothing item.</li>
          <li><b>Users have difficulty navigating pages with infinite scroll</b>. They lose a sense of
            where they are and where to locate previously seen content.</li>
        </ul>
